## News
Pachyderm v0.8 is out. v0.8 includes a brand new pipelining system. [Read more](pachyderm.io/pps) about it or check out our [web scraper demo](https://medium.com/pachyderm-data/build-your-own-wayback-machine-in-10-lines-of-code-99884b2ff95c)

WE'RE HIRING! Love Docker, Go and distributed systems? Email us at jobs@pachyderm.io

## What is Pachyderm?
Pachyderm is a complete data analytics solution that lets you efficiently store and analyze your data using containers. We offer the scalability and broad functionality of Hadoop, with the ease of use of Docker.

## Key Features
- Complete version control for your data
- Jobs are containerized, so you can use any languages and tools you want
- Both batched and streaming analytics
- One-click deploy on AWS without data migration 

## Is Pachyderm enterprise production ready?
No, Pachyderm is in beta, but can already solve some very meaningful data analytics problems.  [We'd love your help. :)](#how-do-i-hack-on-pfs)

## What is a commit-based file system?
Pfs is implemented as a distributed layer on top of btrfs, the same
copy-on-write file system that powers Docker. Btrfs already offers
[git-like semantics](http://zef.me/6023/who-needs-git-when-you-got-zfs/) on a
single machine; pfs scales these out to an entire cluster. This allows features such as:
- Commit-based history: File systems are generally single-state entities. Pfs,
on the other hand, provides a rich history of every previous state of your
cluster. You can always revert to a prior commit in the event of a
disaster.
- Branching: Thanks to btrfs's copy-on-write semantics, branching is ridiculously
cheap in pfs. Each user can experiment freely in their own branch without
impacting anyone else or the underlying data. Branches can easily be merged back in the main cluster.
- Cloning: Btrfs's send/receive functionality allows pfs to efficiently copy
an entire cluster's worth of data while still maintaining its commit history.

## What are containerized analytics?
Rather than thinking in terms of map or reduce jobs, pps thinks in terms of pipelines expressed within a container. A pipeline is a generic way expressing computation over large datasets and itâ€™s containerized to make it easily portable, isolated, and easy to monitor. In Pachyderm, all analysis runs in containers. You can write them in any language you want and include any libraries. 

### Deploying a Pachyderm cluster
Pachyderm is designed to run on CoreOS so we'll need to deploy a CoreOs cluster. We've created an AWS cloud template to make this insanely easy.
- [Deploy on Amazon EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Pachyderm&templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpachyderm-templates%2Ftemplate) using cloud templates (recommended)
- [Amazon EC2](https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/cloud-providers/ec2/) (manual)
- [Google Compute Engine](https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/cloud-providers/google-compute-engine/) (manual)
- [Vagrant](https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/) (requires setting up DNS)

### Deploy Pachyderm manually
If you chose any of the manual options above, you'll neeed to SSH in to one of your new CoreOS machines and start Pachyderm.

```shell
$ curl pachyderm.io/deploy | sh
```
The startup process takes a little while the first time you run it because
each node has to pull a Docker image.

###  Settings
By default the deploy script will create a cluster with 3 shards and 3
replicas. However you can pass it flags to change this behavior:

```shell
$ ./deploy -h
Usage of /go/bin/deploy:
  -container="pachyderm/pfs": The container to use for the deploy.
  -replicas=3: The number of replicas of each shard.
  -shards=3: The number of shards in the deploy.
```

### Integrating with s3
If you'd like to populate your Pachyderm cluster with your own data, [jump ahead](https://github.com/pachyderm/pfs#using-pfs) to learn how. If not, we've created a public s3 bucket with chess data for you and we can run the chess pipeline in the full cluster.

As of v0.4 pfs can leverage s3 as a source of data for jobs. Pfs also
uses s3 as the backend for its local Docker registry. To get s3 working you'll
need to provide pfs with credentials by setting them in etcd like so:

```
etcdctl set /pfs/creds/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
etcdctl set /pfs/creds/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
etcdctl set /pfs/creds/IMAGE_BUCKET <IMAGE_BUCKET>
```

### Checking the status of your deploy
The easiest way to see what's going on in your cluster is to use `list-units`,
this is what a healthy 3 Node cluster looks like.
```
UNIT                            MACHINE                         ACTIVE          SUB

storage.service     e0874908.../10.240.235.196  active  exited
```

## The Pachyderm HTTP API
Pfs exposes a "git-like" interface to the file system -- you can add files and then create commits, branches, etc.

### Creating files
```shell
# Write <file> to <branch>. Branch defaults to "master".
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/file/<file>?branch=<branch> -T local_file
```

### Reading files
```shell
# Read <file> from <master>.
$ curl <hostname>/file/<file>

# Read all files in a <directory>.
$ curl <hostname>/file/<directory>/*

# Read <file> from <commit>.
$ curl <hostname>/file/<file>?commit=<commit>
```

### Deleting files
```shell
# Delete <file> from <branch>. Branch defaults to "master".
$ curl -XDELETE <hostname>/file/<file>?branch=<branch>
```

### Committing changes
```shell
# Commit dirty changes to <branch>. Defaults to "master".
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/commit?branch=<branch>

# Getting all commits.
$ curl -XGET <hostname>/commit
```

### Branching
```shell
# Create <branch> from <commit>.
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/branch?commit=<commit>&branch=<branch>

# Commit to <branch>
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/commit?branch=<branch>

# Getting all branches.
$ curl -XGET <hostname>/branch
```
##Containerized Analytics

###Creating a new pipeline descriptor

Pipelines and jobs are specified as JSON files in the following format:

```
{
    "type"  : either "map" or "reduce"
    "input" : a directory in pfs, S3 URL, or the output from another job
    "image" : the Docker image to use 
    "command" : the command to start your web server
}
```

**NOTE**: You do not need to specify the output location for a job. The output of a job, often referred to as a _materialized view_, is automatically stored in pfs `/job/<jobname>`.

###POSTing a job to pfs

Post a local JSON file with the above format to pfs:

```sh
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/job/<jobname> -T <localfile>.json
```

**NOTE**: POSTing a job doesn't run the job. It just records the specification of the job in pfs. 

###Running a job
Jobs are only run on a commit. That way you always know exactly the state of
the file system that is used in a computation. To run all committed jobs, use
the `commit` keyword with the `run` parameter.

```sh
$ curl -XPOST <hostname>/commit?run
```

Think of adding jobs as constructing a
[DAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computations that
you want performed. When you call `/commit?run`, Pachyderm automatically
schedules the jobs such that a job isn't run until the jobs it depends on have
completed.

###Getting the output of a job
Each job records its output in its own read-only file system. You can read the output of the job with:

```sh
$ curl <host>/job/<jobname>/file/*?commit=<commit>
```
or get just a specific file with:
```sh
$ curl -XGET <host>/job/<job>/file/*?commit=<commit>
```

**NOTE**: You must specify the commit you want to read from and that commit
needs to have been created with the run parameter. We're planning to expand
this API to make it not have this requirement in the near future.
###Creating a job:


### Deleting jobs

```shell
# Delete <job>
$ curl -XDELETE <host>/job/<job>
```

### Getting the job descriptor

```shell
# Read <job>
$ curl -XGET <host>/job/<job>
```

## How do I hack on pfs?
We're hiring! If you like ambitious distributed systems problems and think there should be a better alternative to Hadoop, please reach out.  Email jobs@pachyderm.io

### Want to hack on pfs for fun?
You can run pfs locally using:

```shell
scripts/dev-launch
```

This will build a docker image from the working directory, tag it as `pfs` and
launch it locally using `scripts/launch`.  The only dependencies are Docker >=
1.5 and btrfs-tools >= 3.14. The script checks for this and gives you
directions on how to fix it.

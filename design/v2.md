# Pachyderm v2

## Notable new features

### A diff-oriented processing model

In v1, PPS only processes additions.  That is, if an input commit modifies/deletes data, PPS only processes the positive diffs, but ignores the negative diffs.

In v2, PPS processes diffs the way you'd expect.  For instance, if you remove some input data, downstream pipelines will know to remove the output that were produced as a result of processing the said input data.

### A vastly simplified and more powerful partition scheme

In v1, the way input data is partitioned among parallel pods is determined by two flags: "partition" and "incremental".  These flags have been a pain point because they are not intuitive (quick test, what does `partition=DIR` and `incremental=FULL` mean exactly?) and are not powerful enough to allow for some fairly common usage patterns (e.g. when you update a file `/dir/foo`, you want to reprocess the entire directory `/dir`).

In v2, you control how the input data is partitioned by specifying a single [glob](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html) pattern.  A couple examples:

* Partition objects under the root directory:`*` or `/*`
* Partition objects under directory `/dir`: `/dir/*`
* Process the entire repo for each commit: `` or `/`
* Process the entire directory `/dir` for each commit: `/dir`

Essentially, you can imagine that you are using an infinitely file system, and the input data that you want to process is selected via a single glob pattern.

This also implies that a pipeline can process only a subset of an input repo.  For instance, You might have two pipelines that take the same repo as input, but have different glob patterns:

* Pipeline 1: `/foo/*`
* Pipeline 2: `/bar/*`

In this case, if something under `/foo` changed, pipeline 1 gets triggered.  If something under `/bar` changed, pipeline 2 gets triggered.

## Persistent Store

Under the new architecture, all persistent state is stored under etcd (v3).  We pick etcd for the following reasons:

* Support for multi-object transactions.  This will get rid of a host of inconsistency issues that we've occasionally run into (e.g. commit size doesn't match all file sizes adding up).
* Support for a "[watch](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/api.html#waiting-for-a-change)" mechanism.  Watch is similar to RethinkDB's changefeed in that it's a way for clients to be notified of server-side events (e.g. a commit is added).  However, it's much more robust, primarily because it's implemented with long-polling, as opposed to changefeeds which basically "fire and forget", meaning that messages can be lost due to network issues. 
* Known to work on Kubernetes.  In fact, Kubernetes itself stores all persistent state in etcd.
* In-house expertise.  We are already using etcd for PPS's sharding mechanism, so we are fairly familiar with the software.
* Maturity and active development.  etcd is being used by some of the largest cloud software such as Kubernetes itself.  It's also being actively developed in the open (in constrast with Rethink, which hasn't seen a commit since the company shuts down).

## PFS

### Repos

Each repo's metadata is stored as an object with the prefix `/repos/`.

#### CreateRepo(name)

```
txnBegin
  put /repos/name <metadata>
  put /refs/name/master "" (empty string)
txnEnd
```

#### InspectRepo(name)

`get /repos/name`

#### ListRepo

`get -prefix /repos/`

#### DeleteRepo(name)

```
txnBegin
  delete /repos/name
  delete -prefix /commits/name/
txnEnd
```

### Commits

#### StartCommit(repo, parent)

```
txnBegin
  t := <new-uuid>
  p := get /commits/repo/parent
  if p == nil {
    r := get /refs/repo/parent
    if r != nil {
      usingRef := true
      p = get /commits/repo/r
    }
  }
  c := <new-commit-metadata>
  c.trees = p.trees + t
  commitID := <new-uuid>
  put /commits/repo/commitID c 
  if usingRef {
    put /refs/repo/parent commitID
  }
txnEnd
```

#### FinishCommit(repo, commit)



* How do branches / refs work?

/refs/repo/master -> commit ID?

* How does provenance work?  Given a commit, how do you get all commits that has the said commit as provenance?

Have a /provenance prefix.

When you start commit foo that has bar as provenance, create: /provenance/bar/foo

To get all commits that have bar as provenance, get /provenance/bar
